3.1

Mostly bug fixes and emulator updates, but there is also a new feature that many have asked for, choosing emulators per game!
Change emulator per system: On the main menu select "GAME SETTINGS" > "ADVANCED" > [Choose system] > "EMULATOR"
Change emulator per game: Navigate to the game you want to choose emu for, press select on the gamepad (Game options menu) choose "ADVANCED GAME OPTIONS" > "EMULATOR"


------------------

3.0

Huge update!

New look, new logo (by Prizco), and intro video (by ElF0rma) included! 

Emulationstation now has many new options coming from Batocera-emulationstation and adapted for EmuELEC

Notable features include: 

* Game Settings: You can set some setting that are used on Retroarch directly on this menu, can be set (by priority) per game, per system or globally
* Background music has been upgraded and it now shows the titles, music still goes into /storage/roms/BGM
* Bluetooth controllers! Easy to pair Bluetooth controllers (still need a keybord or other gamepad first)
* Wifi has been revamped, you can still use the old method (By script in setup) or use the on-screen-keyboard to connect to WiFi directly from ES!
* ES Built-in scraper is now working, but Skyscrapper and Selph's scraper are still included
* Themes and Bezels can now be downloaded directly from ES (in menu: system settings, updates)
* Multi language support!
* Many other new features and small changes!


Fixes: 

All platforms:

* OpenBOR: Removed gl4es, it now uses less resources to run
* ResidualVM is now included, put roms in /storage/roms/residualvm, use the included "Scan ResidualVM games" script to populate the list (see note 1)
* ScummVM now includeds a "Scan ScummVM Games" script to populate the list

* Almost all emulators/cores updated to current versions

S905

Many more small bug fixes and changes, check the git history for those.

Note 1: ResidualVM still has a small bug where the pointer in GUI will not show, so you might need a keyboard to run some games, after the game has started you can use the gamepad withouth an issue.

2.5 

Initial EmuELEC release

Sx05RE is now EmuELEC, a pure emulation build that does not include Kodi or anything else related to Kodi in order to free resources and space.
The main goal of EmuELEC is to be the best and easiest wat to emulate retro games on Amlogic hardware.

However if you still like to have Kodi on the same installation, you can also use the Kodi Add-on version. But keep in mind it will have less features than EmuELEC
